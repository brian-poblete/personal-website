## Welcome to Brian Poblete's Personal Website

Hello there, I am a Freshman student at UC Merced, and I am majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. I am passionate about Computer Science because in this field I am able to learn how to develop websites, mobile applications and othellr skills to develop the technology of tomorrow. 

I will be the first Software Engineer in my family and I am excited at the possibility of working in a technology company where I will be learning and contributing in building technology that people around the world might use. 

Some of my interests are Machine Learning, Web Development, and Mobile App Development. 


### Personal Project
My first website was the "Culture at MacArthur Park" page, which displayed remarkable pieces of art scattered throughout the area. https://app-806.ucm.kyrilov.xyz
